# sql-workshop

This is material for [Hashrocket][hr]'s SQL workshop at Code Platoon. SQL is a
technology we are passionate about as a company, and we have enjoyed providing
a hands-on deep-dive into this subject for Code Platoon cohorts over the years.

Check the [Agenda][agenda] to see how the day will progress.

### Setup

Prerequisites: [PostgreSQL][pg]. If you can enter psql, we're in business:

```
$ psql
psql (11.1, server 9.5.17)
user=#
```

We'll be starting with the Phone Book domain.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jwworth/sql-workshop
$ cd sql-workshop/phone_book
```

Open up the `lesson.sql` you find there in your text editor.
