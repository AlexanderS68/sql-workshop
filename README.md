# sql-workshop

This is material for Hashrocket's SQL workshop at Code Platoon. SQL is a
technology we are passionate about as a company, and we have enjoyed providing
a hands-on deep-dive into this subject for Code Platoon cohorts over the years.

Check the [Agenda](agenda.md) to see how the day will progress.

### Setup
