# Hashrocket / Code Platoon SQL Workshop Agenda

This document outlines the plan for our workshop. We'll be taking a short break
once per hour.

### 9:00 Greetings and Reading Review

We'll get to know each other! Jake and Jack will introduce themselves, and then
you'll introduce yourself.

Then, we'll cover the assigned reading about databases.

### 9:45 SQL at the PostgreSQL REPL

*General Advice:*

1. Rather than copy-pasting, try typing the commands into the REPLâ€” that's the
   fastest way to learn! Tab-complete, `CTRL-R` (search) and `CTRL-P` (the 'up'
   arrow) are your friends.
2. Please maximize your terminal window and your font size! Code should always
   be easy to read.
3. If you get stuck, let us know right away! We want you to succeed today. Best
   debugging tip: read the error message.

Throughout the day, we will create a PostgreSQL database and add to it,
covering the basic SQL commands. Expect a short introduction to the command,
followed by learning how it works via practice.

Some commands and concepts we'll cover:

- `create`
- `select` columns and `*`
- `where`
- `like` and `ilike`
- `insert`
- `null`
- `update`
- `delete`
- Primary keys
- `order`
- `limit`
- `and`
- `or`
- `in`

### 11:00 Data Modeling Exercises

[data_modeling/exercise.md][exercise]

### 12:00 Lunch

### 1:00 Exercises
