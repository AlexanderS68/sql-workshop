# Hashrocket / Code Platoon SQL Workshop Agenda

This document outlines the plan for our workshop. We'll be taking a short break
once per hour.

### 9:00 Greetings and Reading Review

We'll get to know each other and cover the assigned reading about databases.

### 9:30 SQL at the PostgreSQL REPL

*General Advice:*

1. Try typing the commands into the REPL rather than copying and pasting; that
   is the fastest way to learn! Tab-complete, `CTRL-R`, and `CTRL-P` (the up
   arrow) are your friends.
2. Please maximize your terminal window and your font size! The code should be
   easy to read.
3. If you get stuck, let us know! The error message contains the path forward.
   Falling behind isn't fun.

Throughout the day, we will create a PostgreSQL database and add to it,
covering the basic SQL commands. Expect a short introduction to the command,
followed by learning how it works via practice.

Some commands and concepts we'll cover:

- `create`
- `select` columns and `*`
- `where`
- `like` and `ilike`
- `insert`
- `null`
- `update`
- `delete`
- Primary keys
- `order`
- `limit`
- `and`
- `or`
- `in`

### 12:00 Lunch

### 1:00 Exercises

We will dive deeper into our database, exploring advanced keywords and working
through more difficult data challenges.

- `offset`
- `join`
- `null` (advanced)
- Aggregate functions

### 3:00 Data Modeling Exercises

[data_modeling/exercise.md][exercise]

### 4:00 Q & A
